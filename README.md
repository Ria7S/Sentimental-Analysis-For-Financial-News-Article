# Sentimental-Analysis-For-Financial-News-Article
The primary goal of the project is to develop a sentiment analysis system that can automatically 
determine the sentiment of financial news articles as positive, negative, or neutral. This analysis helps 
investors and financial professionals make more informed decisions by quickly gauging marketÂ 
sentiment.
